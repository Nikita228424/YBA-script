## YBA: A Deeper Dive into the Stands

This repository contains a script designed to enhance your experience in YBA (Your Bizarre Adventure), the popular Roblox game inspired by the world of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.  It's not about gaining an unfair advantage, it's about gaining a deeper understanding of the game's mechanics and environment.

### Unveiling the Secrets: Tools for Stand Mastery

This script leverages Roblox's API to access game data and render it as additional visual information on top of the standard YBA interface. Think of it as a powerful analytical tool that can help you become a true Stand master!

**Here's what you can expect:**

* **Stand Stats:**  View real-time stats for your Stand and for other players' Stands, including their current abilities and cooldown timers.
* **Enemy Weakness Detection:** Identify weaknesses in opponents' Stands, allowing you to make strategic decisions during battles.
* **Stand Movement Tracking:**  Observe the movement patterns of your Stand and your opponents' Stands, giving you an edge in combat.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Gain a clearer understanding of the battlefield and optimize your Stand's positioning for maximum impact.

**This is not a tool for cheating; it's a tool for strategy.** Use it to improve your Stand skills, outmaneuver your opponents, and become a true master of the YBA arena.
